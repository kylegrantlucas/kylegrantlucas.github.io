My personal website, built with 11ty.

## Goals

The main goal with my personal site build this time around was simplicity. I didn't want to maintain a complex javascript app or build process.

I already keep my resume in [another GitHub repo]() so I thought it would be fun to have my personal website generate off of that file, keeping my resume and website in sync at all times.

I chose 11ty because it allowed for minimal configuration and code to achieve this goal.

There are 2 reasons I chose to deploy the site to Netlify:

1. I didn't want to keep the compiled HTML files stored in the repo, a requirement of GitHub Pages.
2. I like exploring the different cloud offerings and have found Netlify quite enjoyable to use.
